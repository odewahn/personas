**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: The AI field is large and has many different opinions about its impact.

COMPELLING: There is, of course, the whole AI space is huge and there is no shortage of perspectives and strong opinions and stronger opinions on generative AI and its impact.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Some people think AI will change everything about work and more.

COMPELLING: Some see it as a revolutionary force that will fundamentally transform everything about how we work and probably beyond that.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Others think AI is just another tool that will fit into current practices.

COMPELLING: And others view it as just another tool and maybe hype that will be absorbed into existing practices with minimal disruptions.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: AI is changing how people create and use code, but it doesn't replace human decision-making.

COMPELLING: AI is definitely significantly altering workflows for where people generate code, use code, but it's not replacing human judgment.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Many in the industry are discussing the need for skill development.

COMPELLING: We're seeing a lot of the industry currently talking about upskilling and we'll talk about upskilling today.
**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: This change cannot be overlooked, but there are areas where AI is useful and areas where human skills remain important.

COMPELLING: This shift is not one that can be ignored, but there are places where AI can help out and there are places where your durable human skills are going to continue to be really important and really be needed.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: AI can create initial versions of projects quickly, but struggles with the final details needed for completion.

COMPELLING: AI can quickly produce working drafts, prototypes, MVPs, especially for evergreen apps pretty well, but then it really struggles with that final 30% that makes code production ready.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Leaders need to balance AI use with maintaining important aspects like code quality and team development.

COMPELLING: And I think that as leaders, people are going to have to understand how to balance AI adoption with maintaining the things that really matter, maintaining code quality, knowledge sharing, and skill development in your teams.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Upskilling is a significant topic of discussion.

COMPELLING: But yeah, there's a lot that we can talk about with respect to upskilling. I think that that's going to be the word of the day, upskill.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: There is ongoing debate and strong opinions on this topic.

COMPELLING: Yeah, and I think one point that I really want to pull out from what you just described is that there is a lot of debate around this currently. There's also a lot of, again, a lot of strong opinions around it.
**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: There are many opinions about it.

COMPELLING: A lot of strong opinions around it.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Leaders find it ambiguous.

COMPELLING: And so I think it comes with a lot of ambiguity for many leaders dealing with this.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Handling ambiguity is a challenge in leadership roles.

COMPELLING: Which in itself, the handling ambiguity is a challenge in a lot of leadership roles.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: AI helps experienced developers more than beginners.

COMPELLING: I've noticed that AI can help experienced developers, in many cases, more than beginners.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: This seems counterintuitive.

COMPELLING: Which can seem a little bit backwards.
**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: AI can help people learn to code, but it often requires oversight.

COMPELLING: We talk about AI helping democratize coding, but the reality is often that AI is a lot like having a very eager junior engineer on your team.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: AI can produce code quickly but needs supervision.

COMPELLING: They can write code pretty quickly, but they do need regular supervision and correction.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Understanding model capabilities helps in guiding them.

COMPELLING: The more that you know about how well models are able to handle particular kinds of problems, the better you can guide them.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Junior members use AI to learn, reducing their reliance on traditional resources.

COMPELLING: Your juniors will try to use AI to learn what to do, so they're not necessarily looking at stack overflow or reading docs or tutorials quite as much as maybe they used to.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: With clear requirements, they can quickly create prototypes.

COMPELLING: They've got a clear idea of requirements or what needs to get built. They can rapidly go and prototype ideas that they already understand.
**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Use your abilities to improve and adapt the code to meet the team's requirements.

COMPELLING: to use your skills to refine it, make it more maintainable, shape it into what your team actually needs.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: You feel satisfied when you input a command and see results in the browser.

COMPELLING: You feel really good. You can type in a prompt and you get something that renders in the browser, and you feel really good.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: They might accept wrong or outdated methods because they don't know how to ask the right questions.

COMPELLING: That can mean as well that sometimes they will accept incorrect or outdated solutions or ways of doing things because they didn't exactly know how to ask for the right flavor of how to solve a problem.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: You might create systems you don't fully understand but still feel like you've contributed.

COMPELLING: It can also lead to things like building systems that you don't fully understand, but you've put the code in the pull request, and so you feel like, hey, I've actually contributed something.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: This is an exciting time for faster work, but it requires more awareness.

COMPELLING: I think that this is a very exciting time for velocity and first being able to get things done quicker, but it does require so much more mindfulness.
**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Leaders need to assist their teams in understanding this area.

COMPELLING: where leaders especially need to step in and help their teams navigate this space.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Upskilling is a key focus right now.

COMPELLING: I think that I mentioned upskilling is the word of the day.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: You will likely need to spend time teaching your teams to work with Gen AI.

COMPELLING: You are going to probably spend a decent amount of time through this period needing to upskill your teams to effectively work with Gen AI.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: You should understand the field.

COMPELLING: You need to roll up your sleeves and understand the landscape.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: At Google, all levels are actively trying different things.

COMPELLING: At Google, in my work, all of those levels are proactively investing time in trying out different
**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: People at different job levels are trying out new tools and models.

COMPELLING: At Google, in my work, all of those levels are proactively investing time in trying out different tools, different models themselves.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: It's a good time to update your skills if you haven't been coding much recently.

COMPELLING: Even if you're someone who hasn't been coding quite as heavily over the last couple of years, it's a moment for you to come back and refresh your skills a little bit.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: People change their views on AI in software engineering after using the tools.

COMPELLING: What I've seen is that there are cases where a person may have had a perspective about the role of AI in software engineering before they had a chance to try out the tools and try out the models and understand what's possible, and then after their perspectives changed drastically.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: You need to allow your team to explore, but also know what's possible.

COMPELLING: You have to create the space for your team to do it, absolutely, but you need to understand what's possible.
**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: AI is useful for new applications.

COMPELLING: AI is great for evergreen apps.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: You are starting from nothing.

COMPELLING: You're starting from a clean slate, effectively.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: You need to be clear about how tools are used.

COMPELLING: You may need to be a lot more explicit about how and where many of these tools and these models can be used.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: In startups or on social networks, it feels like everyone is using new tools.

COMPELLING: In the startup world or on different social networks, every day it can feel like, hey, somebody is using Cursor, Windsurf, Climb, Bolt, V0, and they're off to the races.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Leaders should improve their skills and be proactive.

COMPELLING: For leaders, for this moment, upskill, be proactive about doing that.
**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Many companies offer free AI courses.

COMPELLING: Almost every large company has now published free courses on AI.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Choose a project you want to work on and start using the tools.

COMPELLING: Pick a problem, pick a type of app or something that you've personally wanted to build, maybe it's a hobby project or something, and literally just go start trying out the tools.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: It's easy to use these tools to create something.

COMPELLING: The bar for being able to use them to generate something is very low now.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Try using Bolt and V0 to see their capabilities.

COMPELLING: Even if you're just able to carve out an hour, go try out Bolt, go try out V0, go try out these things just to see what is possible now.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: As you use these tools, you'll notice their strengths and limitations.

COMPELLING: As you incrementally try out these tools, you will start to see where they're really strong. You will also start to see that cliff where the returns on investment begin to diminish.
**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Juniors should be cautious, and you should assist them in identifying problems.

COMPELLING: is really where juniors need to be careful, so you need to be able to help them spot those issues.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: People will need to decide whether to stop using these tools or start creating solutions manually.

COMPELLING: It's also where people will need to either eject from these tools or start to go back into the mode of manually hand-crafting solutions.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Experimenting on your own is the best advice I can offer at the moment.

COMPELLING: Try things out yourself. That is the best resource I can give you right now, I think.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Let's discuss your role as a leader who is knowledgeable about AI and wants to implement tools for the team.

COMPELLING: Let's talk a bit about, say, you as a leader, you know your stuff, you've looked a bit into AI yourself, know what tools are out there, have a first sense of how to adapt it for your team, you want to introduce some tooling to your team now.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Many people in the industry feel pressured to adopt AI because it is said to boost productivity.

COMPELLING: I think the most common mistakes are, you know, everybody in the industry right now, or most people, are feeling the pressure of like, okay, I keep hearing the AI is increasing productivity and we have to jump on this bandwagon.
**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: People often say AI is making work more efficient, and we should adopt it.

COMPELLING: keep hearing the AI is increasing productivity and we have to jump on this bandwagon.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Are we going to let people work on small projects to learn?

COMPELLING: And are we just going to create the space for people to prototype and hack on small personal things on the side and ramp up that way?

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Maybe we can have a team event to try AI tools on non-essential projects.

COMPELLING: Or maybe we'll do a team hackathon where we try to come up with projects where we're using AI coding tools to generate something that could be just interesting, but not in the critical path.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Many people don't know how to implement this with their teams.

COMPELLING: I see a lot of people who don't have a clear idea of like, how to roll this out to their teams.
**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Understanding the requirements of the business and regulations is crucial.

COMPELLING: It also becomes very important, again, building on another point, to understand what the business requirements may be and the regulatory requirements may be around what you're doing.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Startups might have more flexibility with tools and data management.

COMPELLING: Because again, if you were in a startup, maybe you have a lot of flexibility, maybe you can use all the shiny new tools and models and you care a lot less about where your code and data ends up going.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Enterprises might need to use safer tools or local solutions.

COMPELLING: If you're in the enterprise, it may be very different. Your company may actually not be able to use these tools directly. They may need to use ones that are slightly more enterprise safe, or you may need to tell your team, well, hey, we're going to have to do something using an on-prem solution or local models instead.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Change management and leadership strategies are applicable here.

COMPELLING: Yeah, I would tack on to that, that I think general change management approaches and change leadership approaches, also apply them here.
**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Change management and leadership strategies are applicable here.

COMPELLING: I think general change management approaches and change leadership approaches, also apply them here.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Many people find this topic exciting, but some find it frightening.

COMPELLING: For a lot of people, this is a topic that's, yes, very exciting. But for other people, it's also quite scary.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: People are concerned about job security.

COMPELLING: A lot of people are worried about job safety and all of that.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Good leadership involves understanding and planning for your team.

COMPELLING: So adapting or adopting general good leadership practices, like understanding your team, knowing your team members, planning this kind of change that doesn't have to mean it needs to be a one-year plan, but going at it with thought around security, for example, practices around legal aspects, but also in terms of how you communicate to your team, and then how big you also make the promises that are connected to it.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: We can discuss the specifics of the rollout plan.

COMPELLING: And we can be specific. When we talk about, being explicit about rollout plan, we can talk about details there as well.
**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: We should discuss the specifics of the implementation plan.

COMPELLING: being explicit about rollout plan, we can talk about details there as well.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Consider how this will impact your team daily.

COMPELLING: I think that as you think through the plan for how you're going to help your team navigate through this, you also want to think about how does this affect them on a day-to-day?

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: AI is being integrated into various development tools.

COMPELLING: We're seeing tooling companies rolling out AI, not just in the editor, not just in the developer tools, but all the way through CI.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Ensure a human checks the AI-generated work.

COMPELLING: You want to be very careful about, hey, AI wrote the code. AI is validating the output. Was there a human in the loop to just make sure that none of this was actually completely wrong?

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: As automation increases, confirming the output is crucial.

COMPELLING: As we move towards more and more automation, it's going to become just important to validate that the output is exactly what you wanted.
**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Consider creating effective methods for sharing knowledge to manage the risks associated with understanding how software is developed.

COMPELLING: Start to think more about good knowledge-sharing protocols to address those risks of understanding how components or apps are built.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Ensure that you are considering the future maintenance of the code and whether it is well-documented.

COMPELLING: You have to make sure that you're also thinking about the long term. Who's going to maintain the code? Do they understand how it works? Do we have documentation? Do we need documentation?

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: It is important to verify AI-generated code, similar to how you would check the work of a junior engineer.

COMPELLING: Implementing what I'd say is a good trust-but-verify standard practice for AI-generated code is going to be important as well. Just make sure, the same way again, that you would probably verify the output that a junior engineer is working on for your project.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: When acquiring new tools for your company, evaluate them carefully.

COMPELLING: And same as you're doing when your company's purchasing another tool, look at it with those lenses as well.
**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: It depends on the projects you are working on.

COMPELLING: I think that, again, it depends on the type of projects that you're working on.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Ensure you do not rely too much on AI.

COMPELLING: But you need to make sure that you are not over-relying.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Sometimes, when a model provider is unavailable, engineers cannot continue their work.

COMPELLING: I've seen plenty of stories in the Bay Area where a model provider is down for a couple of hours or some time, and suddenly the engineers on the team don't know how to proceed.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: It is unusual to say, but it happens in some teams now.

COMPELLING: Which is so strange a thing to say, but it is a reality in some teams these days now.
**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Implementing days without AI could help maintain skills.

COMPELLING: So the solution to that might be to implement no AI days, for example, for skill maintenance.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: It might not be a good idea.

COMPELLING: Maybe that's a dumb idea.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Many junior engineers use AI for concepts they don't fully grasp.

COMPELLING: We see a lot of junior engineers who are using AI for concepts they may not necessarily understand.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: I make sure to review AI-generated content for a few minutes.

COMPELLING: And I make sure that if I'm generating something, I take a few minutes, even if it's five to 10 minutes, to read through what's been done.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: If AI stops being helpful, I need to understand the system myself.

COMPELLING: Because that moment that AI stops being able to be helpful in helping me move forward, I'm going to need to step in.
**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: I need to understand the system by reading the code regularly.

COMPELLING: And I will need to be able to reason about the system myself.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: People are concerned about AI affecting code quality.

COMPELLING: I think that quality, people definitely worry about, hey, is the quality of the code that we're working on going to degrade because we're having AI generate it?

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: AI models can create complexity if not guided properly.

COMPELLING: And sometimes AI can, models, if you're not explicit, a model is going to go with what its system prompt might be encouraging it to do or what it's been trained on.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Avoid relying too much on AI.

COMPELLING: Try to not use AI as a crutch too much.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: We will discuss AI's impact on code quality more in the future.

COMPELLING: I do think in the next year, we're going to start to see more conversations about, are we measuring AI's impact on code quality enough?
**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: It is important to have a clear plan when adopting AI.

COMPELLING: But definitely having a clear plan, very important.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: I would like to discuss the guidelines for introducing AI.

COMPELLING: I'd like to talk a bit more about some of the guardrails around introduction of AI.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Security, maintainability, and scalability are important goals for teams.

COMPELLING: Are there other practices around specifically, I think security is one big aspect, but also maintainability and scalability that teams may have goals around?

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: All AI-generated code should be reviewed in a serious business.

COMPELLING: I would make sure that if you're in any serious business that all AI-generated code has to go through a code review of some sort.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Some teams require annotations for AI-generated sections in legacy code.

COMPELLING: I've seen some teams do things like require, especially if you're working on a legacy code base or something that already exists, requiring annotation, for example, or comments if there are sections that are AI-generated.
**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: It is not logical to keep those remarks.

COMPELLING: And it just doesn't make sense to maintain those comments.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: This can be a method for your team to monitor parts or functions not created by a person.

COMPELLING: But that can also be another way for your team just to keep an eye on components or functionality that have not been written by a human.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: People are considering changing their code review rules for AI-related problems.

COMPELLING: I've seen people start to think about updating their code review guidelines for specific checks with AI-generated issues.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Having another person review the process ensures redundancy and understanding for future maintenance.

COMPELLING: But at least having a second pair of eyes on the process means that it's, first of all, redundancy. More than one person is going to be looking at it for issues. But also, more than one person will hopefully also understand what has been built in case additional maintenance is needed at a later time.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: People are increasingly using AI for significant code changes.

COMPELLING: I'm starting to see people really lean into AI for things like big refactors.
**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: You might use AI to start a refactoring process when changing libraries or frameworks.

COMPELLING: So to give you an example, maybe if you're refactoring from using one kind of library or one kind of framework to another, maybe you have AI do the first pass.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: It's advisable to have an experienced engineer review the AI-generated code.

COMPELLING: But again, you will probably want a senior engineer to step in and audit that code, maybe make it more modular, more reusable.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Teams should establish guidelines for AI code usage.

COMPELLING: And I think that teams probably just need to have clear usage policies for what types of code AI can be used for.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Avoid using AI for code that requires high security.

COMPELLING: And maybe things that are slightly more security sensitive, you don't have AI touch those.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: It's important to be careful and considerate when implementing changes.

COMPELLING: I love that. And I think one big theme across your answers so far has been, again, be thoughtful, be mindful in terms of how you're adapting things, and understand what you're talking about, but also work with your team in how you do this, which I think is really spot on.
**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Some people are worried about this.

COMPELLING: Some people are very concerned about this.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Junior people are unsure about their growth and job opportunities.

COMPELLING: Some, I think especially people who are more junior, wonder about how they're going to grow or maybe struggling to find job opportunities.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Leaders should address team concerns when introducing AI.

COMPELLING: And so when you as a leader are at a point where you want to introduce some generative AI to your team, how do you best speak to concerns that people on your team may have who are maybe slightly less excited about all of it?

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Some people doubt AI's usefulness for their projects.

COMPELLING: And some people are very, very skeptical that AI is going to be useful in any way for their projects and that they should just ignore it.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Others are very eager to use AI.

COMPELLING: There are some people who are very, very excited about really, really heavily leaning in.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: AI can automate some parts of software development.

COMPELLING: And I think the reality is that AI is capable of automating a non-trivial percentage of the software development process.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: AI mostly automates uninteresting tasks.

COMPELLING: But I would highlight that as likely being the boring parts.
**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: It often produces standard code.

COMPELLING: it's generating what's effectively boilerplate code in a lot of cases,

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: It can remove some tedious tasks.

COMPELLING: That can eliminate some of the boring parts of the job.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: I am optimistic that AI will handle simple tasks.

COMPELLING: I'm hopeful that if AI is automating more of the boring parts of coding, like the basic stuff,

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: This will improve our work and help us create better experiences.

COMPELLING: that will elevate our craft and help us focus on trying to create more polish, trying to create higher quality experiences for people.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: I believe roles will change instead of disappearing.

COMPELLING: I think that roles are going to evolve rather than disappear.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: It's important to provide training opportunities.

COMPELLING: And so I think, again, it's important for you to make sure that you are giving your team members opportunities to train and upskill.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Recognize the value of lasting skills.

COMPELLING: Do make sure to recognize the importance of durable skills.
**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: A balance is useful for teams.

COMPELLING: And so I think that a balance is going to be helpful for teams.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Explain how AI helps the team's work and satisfaction, and be honest about its limitations.

COMPELLING: Share how AI is benefiting the team's output and work satisfaction, and just be realistic about places where it's just not quite there yet.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Showing is better than just telling to help the team understand.

COMPELLING: I think that that show versus just telling can really help the team understand, OK, well, yeah, my job isn't going anywhere just yet, because AI still has a lot of room to grow in terms of code quality.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Use AI to boost team productivity, but the team should learn why solutions work.

COMPELLING: So you can use it to amplify team productivity, but the team should absolutely be committing to learning why solutions work.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: People need to keep improving core skills.

COMPELLING: I think that people are going to need to continue to invest in core skills.
**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: I am creating something new, and I feel very productive when using AI to automate parts of the process.

COMPELLING: I'm building something from scratch, I have never felt more productive in my career than I do these days when I'm using AI to help automate some parts of this process.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: AI helps me quickly move from the idea stage to execution.

COMPELLING: It's helping me go from idea to execution very, very fast.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Sometimes, AI provides impressive results.

COMPELLING: There are definitely places where I have magical moments.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: In another project, AI was not as effective and wasted my time.

COMPELLING: There was another project where I tried to do the same thing, and I wasted eight hours of time because it just kept going around in circles and circles and circles and solving the wrong kinds of problems.
**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: It's important to recognize that these systems are not yet perfect.

COMPELLING: And so just being able to understand that these things are not perfect just yet, and there will still very likely be a place for engineers in the loop, I think, is healthy to share with people.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Experienced engineers will remain crucial in this context.

COMPELLING: Senior engineers, I think, are going to continue to be very important here.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: You should use your experience to guide AI and evaluate its results.

COMPELLING: You're going to need to leverage your experience to guide AI and to vet its outputs.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Lead the integration of AI into your team's processes responsibly.

COMPELLING: Take the lead in integrating AI into your team's workflow very responsibly.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Encourage junior engineers to focus on understanding and improving AI-generated code.

COMPELLING: And for juniors, you know, you really want to coach them on focusing on becoming the kind of engineer who understands and can improve the code that AI generates.
**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: We need to be flexible in our approach.

COMPELLING: But on the whole, we're going to need to stay adaptive, I think.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: I appreciated your mention of critical thinking skills.

COMPELLING: And I really liked your call-out of specifically critical thinking skills and kind of demonstrating those on your team.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: A question has been raised about critical thinking.

COMPELLING: One question that's also come up has been around critical thinking specifically.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: As a leader, it's important to set good practices.

COMPELLING: I think what you mentioned in terms of, as a leader, establishing good practices in terms of how things are reviewed and what's being worked on versus having, for example, no AI days.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: This applies to everyone, not just juniors or seniors.

COMPELLING: Yeah, absolutely. And I'll talk about this in terms of juniors and seniors, but I think this actually applies regardless of your level.
**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Encourage juniors to explain AI-generated code to understand it better.

COMPELLING: And so doing things like requiring juniors to explain AI-generated codes line by line, not in a sort of like, hey, I'm looking over your shoulder way, but more of a, hey, do you want to actually understand what this is doing?

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Use AI as a tool for learning, not as a replacement for understanding.

COMPELLING: And it's really about just setting this culture within your team about not using AI as a crutch, but as something that will maybe help us with velocity, but it doesn't remove the need for us to learn and to understand.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: A mixed approach is likely the best.

COMPELLING: Often I think that a hybrid approach is what's probably going to
**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Use AI for initial development, then have an engineer review and improve it before submission.

COMPELLING: So use AI for quick prototyping, then the engineer steps in to understand what's been created, and then we'll refine it towards something that you then submit in a pull request.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Conduct exercises where less experienced individuals work with AI while more experienced ones provide guidance.

COMPELLING: Create pairing exercises. I think that can help as well. Maybe your junior will drive with AI assistance while your seniors observe and navigate and provide them additional guidance.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: A beginner might give a vague instruction to AI and get unsatisfactory results.

COMPELLING: So for example, I always like to give people, this is a very stupid example, but someone new to prompting may do something very naive, like, hey, AI, create me a social network. And you can't be upset if the output of that is not what you wanted because you provided very, very vague requirements.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Experienced individuals know to provide detailed instructions to AI.

COMPELLING: A senior or someone who's been doing this for a while or has critical thinking skills will know that, okay, well, we need to be a little bit more specific. Maybe we need to bring more requirements into the prompt. Maybe we need to bring like a mini PRD or something and just be specific about behavior that we want.
**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: We might need to create a small document to specify desired behaviors.

COMPELLING: Maybe we need to bring like a mini PRD or something and just be specific about behavior that we want.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: There is a difference between casual coding and coding for a long-term project.

COMPELLING: There is a difference between someone sort of just vibe coding something at the weekend for their personal project and something that will need to stand the test of time in a production project.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Experienced team members can assist others in navigating this situation.

COMPELLING: So I think just helping folks within the team navigate this together, especially people who have a lot more experience than others can help in this case.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: I value the culture of knowledge sharing within my team.

COMPELLING: One of the things that I've really appreciated, even that I do with my direct team and that my leaders have certainly done with myself and their reports is establishing or reinvigorating your culture of knowledge sharing.
**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: The state of the art changes frequently.

COMPELLING: where it can feel like every two or three hours, the state of the art has changed.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Creating a culture of open communication is important.

COMPELLING: And so establishing culture where people feel comfortable just sharing their experiences a lot more openly, and then that goes back to psychological safety.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: The organization supports the idea of using AI without pressure.

COMPELLING: If the whole org is bought into this idea that, hey, this is a moment, we're not pressurizing you to use AI, but we think it could help you.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: We are all learning together.

COMPELLING: We're all learning, we're all in this together. We will figure this out together.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: I inform my team about things that didn't work.

COMPELLING: there'll be things where I'm like, oh, hey, this actually didn't work, and I'll send that to my team.
**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Sharing knowledge with your team is important right now.

COMPELLING: But knowledge sharing and how you approach that in your team during this moment is gonna be important.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Mentorship skills are becoming increasingly necessary.

COMPELLING: I think that strengthening mentorship abilities as people are going to need more and more guidance, I think that's gonna be really important.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Understanding the ethical and legal aspects of AI is crucial for some people.

COMPELLING: I think that being able to navigate the ethical and legal requirements around AI usage for some folks is also going to be important.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Validating the quality of AI output is essential.

COMPELLING: But as I was saying earlier, just making sure that you've got good skills around validating the output quality is gonna be important overall.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Leaders should understand how different AI models work with their specific technologies.

COMPELLING: And one particular call out, if you're a leader that has not had a chance to dive in yet and is likely to use public models for the way that your team approach integrating AI into your engineering process, do get a sense of how different models handle the languages, frameworks, tech stacks that you specifically use, because you might be surprised.
**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: I am concerned about the code quality produced.

COMPELLING: I care about the quality of code that it's generating.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Different models have varying strengths.

COMPELLING: There are gonna be cases where Gemini might be really, really strong, and other cases where other models might be strong.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Validate which models are most effective.

COMPELLING: So just take time out to validate what models work best.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Avoid focusing solely on code quantity.

COMPELLING: If you were to just push your team for generating as much code as possible, I mean, we've all heard the measurement of lines of code.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Focusing only on output can lead to unhelpful behaviors.

COMPELLING: But if you're just looking for pure output in all of this, for example, you will get behaviors that just aren't useful for building a sustainable team long-term.
**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: The process you mentioned was correct.

COMPELLING: So I think the process you described there were really spot on.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: I want to discuss quality aspects and ask if leaders should do anything else in that area.

COMPELLING: I do want to talk a little bit more about the quality aspects, and just ask if there's anything else that you think leaders should be doing in that domain,

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: I don't want leaders or engineers to feel they need to become AI experts.

COMPELLING: Yeah, and I don't want leaders or engineers who are building full-stack apps or anything like that to feel like you suddenly have to become a very deep model expert, or AI expert,

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Understanding how model-building teams work is beneficial.

COMPELLING: But it does help you to understand how teams who are building out these models generally approach them.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: I have been developing for the web for a long time and care about models generating quality code.

COMPELLING: And for many of us, at least my skew is that I've been building for the web for decades now, and so I care about making sure that models are generating high-quality sort of JavaScript, and TypeScript, and React code, and Next.js code, and Tailwind code,
**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Ensure that models produce good quality code in various programming languages and frameworks.

COMPELLING: sure that models are generating high-quality sort of JavaScript, and TypeScript, and React code, and Next.js code, and Tailwind code, et cetera.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: The model is likely trained on large, diverse datasets, possibly from GitHub or other licensed sources.

COMPELLING: the model is very likely trained on a big, diverse data sets. Maybe it's GitHub. Maybe it's other kinds of data that were license permissible.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: It is important to understand what the base model knows about your technology stack.

COMPELLING: And so this is where it's important for you to understand, okay, well, what does the base model understand about the tech stack that I'm working on?
**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: There are methods to address that issue to some degree.

COMPELLING: And there are ways to work around that to some extent.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Various tools can help you include current data in your queries.

COMPELLING: Different tools will allow you to do things like ground your query or your prompt in search so it can go and perform a search, include live or recent data as a part of the prompt.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: AI can assist you with modern techniques, but it might need extra effort.

COMPELLING: And so even if you're trying to build something that is using a slightly more modern technique, technology, way of doing things, you can still have AI help you with that, but it may just require a little bit of additional work.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: I often copy documentation into my prompt for AI assistance.

COMPELLING: And so I just get used to the idea that I'll probably have to copy-paste some of our documentation into my prompt if I want the AI to be able to help me with using those APIs in my components and in my apps.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Knowing what extra steps are needed for AI to be effective is crucial.

COMPELLING: But just understanding what extra mild things are going to be needed to make AI effective for your teams, I think it's going to be very important for people.
**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: It is important for people to make AI effective for their teams.

COMPELLING: needed to make AI effective for your teams, I think it's going to be very important for people.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Many people have seen discussions about AI tools helping with coding problems.

COMPELLING: I think that many folks have probably seen the interesting and spicy discussions in the community about people who will install secret, silent AI helpers on their machines to help them with leak code problems and things like that.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: There is often nothing preventing someone from using online resources during an interview.

COMPELLING: there very often hasn't been something to stop them from opening up a Google search or a Stack Overflow and trying to get some help in some way with the problems that they're
**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: People often use online resources to solve problems.

COMPELLING: Google search or a Stack Overflow and trying to get some help in some way with the problems that they're being asked.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Interviews might change to focus on problem-solving skills.

COMPELLING: The way that I think interviews may evolve moving forward is focusing on asking people to talk us through their problem-solving approach and giving them questions that really try to ground them on what are the real-world skills that they have, how do they apply to real-world problems that we are running into every day?

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: You can have candidates work with the team to verify their skills.

COMPELLING: You can have them join the team for a trial period where it's very possible and they're not gonna be able to use AI to exactly solve the same kinds of problems and just validate that they're being effective on their own two feet that way.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Traditional interview questions might change in the future.

COMPELLING: I do see that in the future, it's very likely that the traditional approach to using kind of leet code style questions and interviews, I think that that's going to change.
**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: I believe that will change.

COMPELLING: I think that that's going to change.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: I have always thought that tech interviews are not effective in evaluating skills.

COMPELLING: because I've maintained for a long time, probably slightly spicier take than yours that a lot of tech interviewing just has not been useful for companies to really assess people's skills,

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: The important question is whether people can reason and explain their approach.

COMPELLING: But the question that I found typically, like much more helpful is can people reason about it? Can they explain how they arrived at the approach that they took?

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: I hope this doesn't lead to only in-person interviews.

COMPELLING: And I, you know, I hope that this doesn't all necessarily lead to people only doing in person interviews,
**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Interviews might not always need to be conducted in person.

COMPELLING: doesn't all necessarily lead to people only doing in person interviews, maybe, maybe some, it does encourage more in person.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: I remember interviewing at Google where candidates solved problems without using a computer.

COMPELLING: But I can remember many years of interviewing at Google, where, you know, we'll have the candidate in the room, and they will be solving, they'll be talking about how they solve a problem without necessarily having a laptop immediately out in front of them.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: This method seems outdated.

COMPELLING: That does in some ways, that feels kind of legacy in ways too.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: I hope we can find a balanced way to assess skills without needing in-person presence.

COMPELLING: And I'd hope that we can come up with a balanced approach to evaluating people's skills that doesn't always require them to necessarily be in the room.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: If you worry about cheating in interviews, consider revising the process.

COMPELLING: I was gonna say, like, I think if you have major concerns that people are cheating in your interview process, you might want to look at the interview process.
**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: I want to discuss managing expectations for senior leaders.

COMPELLING: I would like to talk a bit about expectation management, specifically for more senior leaders in your company.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Many executives currently have high expectations.

COMPELLING: A lot of executives have quite high expectations currently,

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Changes have occurred in customer support departments due to AI tools.

COMPELLING: I mean, there have already been changes in, for example, customer support departments, where a lot of folks have been let go as a result of AI tools being introduced.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: People expect savings and productivity improvements.

COMPELLING: But a lot of people have really high expectations in terms of savings, productivity increases, efficiency increases, however you frame it.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: How should leaders handle these conversations?

COMPELLING: What's a good way for leaders to deal with that kind of conversation?

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: This is a broad topic, so I'll cover different aspects.

COMPELLING: I think that, you know, we have been, this is potentially a big topic. So I'll talk about it from a few different dimensions.
**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Companies hired more people during the pandemic due to market trends that were not sustainable.

COMPELLING: We saw a lot of big companies hire a lot or overhire and because they saw trends in the market that ended up not being quite as sustainable.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: This led to corrections and layoffs over the years.

COMPELLING: And so we then saw sort of, you know, that the corrections and layoffs come off the back of that over the years.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: People need to get used to the idea of improving and getting more value from current resources.

COMPELLING: And so I think that it is now, people are used to in some ways, or they're going to have to get used to like, yeah, people are going to keep asking for how are we improving? How are we? Are we squeezing more out of what we have right now?
**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Identify areas where AI can enhance team performance.

COMPELLING: try to get a sense of how AI can practically improve things in your teams

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: You might know where your team is not performing well.

COMPELLING: like you probably have a sense of the places where you're currently suboptimal within your team.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Your team might lack a balanced mix of experience levels.

COMPELLING: Maybe you don't have the right mixture of seniors and juniors.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: You might have unresolved technical issues.

COMPELLING: Maybe, you know, you have a lot of technical debts that you just feel like you're not going to be able to catch up on.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: This is a good time to consider what will remain important in the future.

COMPELLING: This moment is also good for just, you know, zooming out and asking, what is going to continue to still be relevant in the next couple of years.
**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Projects might be replaced or copied by others due to AI, so priorities might change.

COMPELLING: are projects that you feel are going to be, you know, replaced or more easily copied by other companies, because you, we now have AI available to us. And if that's the case, maybe you end up shifting your priorities to other things.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Understanding your team's capabilities is important.

COMPELLING: Yeah, I think the practice of like having a good sense of what your team can and can't do. It's really great.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Communicating this to leaders is beneficial.

COMPELLING: And what you called out and conveying that to your leaders, and you can even outline that as options and say, Hey, you know, we could, for example, focus more on knowledge exchange in the team or on growing more people.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: People might find the answer unclear.

COMPELLING: Absolutely. And if, if, you know, there's always the risk that people find that that answer is fuzzy.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Everyone is dealing with this similarly.

COMPELLING: All of us are navigating this, even those of us who've been in the trenches with AI for a few years, we're all navigating this in very similar ways, I would say.
**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: We are all dealing with this situation in similar ways.

COMPELLING: few years, we're all navigating this in very similar ways, I would say,

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: If you are unsure how to explain the potential productivity improvements to your leaders, you can try setting a tentative goal.

COMPELLING: in fact, if you're not sure how to convey to your leadership, what the potential productivity gains are, what you're going to march towards, what you can, one of the things you can do, and I've seen teams successfully do this, is set yourself a very tentative sort of OKR or stretch goal for the year

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: We will investigate if AI can make us more efficient in those areas.

COMPELLING: we're going to explore, can we actually use AI to make ourselves more efficient in those specific ways.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: If you can agree with leadership that this is an experimental trial, it can provide your team with the freedom to aim for a rough target.

COMPELLING: And if you're able to reach an agreement with leadership that, hey, this is this is a speculative experiment, we don't know, but we're, we're very willing and open to finding out, that can give your team the space to say, okay, well, we've got a rough target,

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: If we do not achieve it, that is acceptable because we are all learning.

COMPELLING: if we don't hit it, that's fine, we're all in learning mode.
**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Leaders should be equipped to make investment decisions.

COMPELLING: equip, you know, the company's leadership to be able to make decisions about investments,

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: AI might only improve our use case by a small percentage.

COMPELLING: okay, well, hey, maybe AI is actually only going to be able to help our particular use case by improved by 5%, rather than 20 or 30 or 40%.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Conduct short-term experiments to understand future directions.

COMPELLING: Yeah, or experiment, like this is a really good use case for even just a short term goal experiment that you're doing with your team. So you can get a quick sense of where things might be heading.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Discuss the usefulness of AI with your team and leadership.

COMPELLING: I would also recommend even if your team is or has some concerns about it, again, try and figure out what what are the areas where it's useful for us where we might be able to do something, but also be honest with your team, as well as the senior leadership, right?
**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Discussing these topics is crucial.

COMPELLING: Open conversations about that is really important.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: It can be difficult to express disagreement early in your career.

COMPELLING: I found that especially if you're early on your career, it can sometimes be tricky to feel like you might be pushing back.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: You can approach it as a negotiation and discuss the pros and cons.

COMPELLING: But you can treat it as a negotiation, you can honestly talk about here are the trade-offs, here are the areas where it's working for us, here's where it isn't.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Executives are aware that no tool can solve all business issues.

COMPELLING: But at the same time, they too know that there isn't a tool that can magically solve all their business problems.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Communicating your team's value is a useful leadership skill.

COMPELLING: And also, if you're able, I think the overall skill of being able to convey the value that your team is owning and providing for the company is always a good leadership skill.
**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: You can expand on that idea.

COMPELLING: And you can build on that.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: In my opinion, I have not seen any proof that this will happen.

COMPELLING: My personal take is that I've seen absolutely zero evidence that that is going to be the case.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: AI can help start new projects from the beginning.

COMPELLING: Again, if you're talking strictly about evergreen, new codebases, new projects where you're starting from scratch, yes, you can use AI to bootstrap a lot of that.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Most engineering jobs involve working on existing projects.

COMPELLING: But I think that for the vast majority of the rest of engineering, every single job I've joined has almost always been, hey, we have something that already exists.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Human skills will still be important for dealing with complexity.

COMPELLING: And that your durable human skills will continue to be important for navigating complexity.
**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Leadership skills are important for dealing with complexity.

COMPELLING: continue to be important for navigating complexity.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: I want to discuss leadership skills because we have limited time.

COMPELLING: Yeah, I kind of want to, because we still have a few minutes, but not many, I would like to bring this around to talking about just leadership skills.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Some leadership skills have stayed the same, while others have changed.

COMPELLING: I think throughout our conversation, there have been a lot of different leadership skills that we've called out some have remained some are changing.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: What is your opinion on how leadership has changed recently?

COMPELLING: What's your take overall? Like what's different for how leaders need to lead now in this moment, maybe over the next couple of years, compared to engineering leadership a couple of years ago?

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Psychological safety has always been important and still is.

COMPELLING: I would say that actually, one thing worth calling out is that historically, and I've talked a little bit about this in the Leading Effective Engineers book, but psychological safety used to be very important and continues to be very important during these moments.
**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Companies are being asked how they use AI in their products.

COMPELLING: teams across the industry who are now, you know, and their companies are facing questions about like, okay, well, how is your company using AI in the consumer facing features or the B2B features that you're rolling out.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: You should not label everything as AI if it doesn't add value.

COMPELLING: And that is another kind of ambiguity that you're going to have to navigate where, you know, you don't just want to be artificially slapping the AI label on every part of your UI and shipping it to people if it's not actually offering value.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Leaders should ensure products are useful and not just use AI unnecessarily.

COMPELLING: And so I think that as a leader, not just for your team, but also for the products that your team are building, you need to hold the bar on quality to make sure that we're actually shipping things that are useful to people and are not just using AI for the sake of it, especially in ways that don't actually help people accomplish what they need to accomplish more efficiently or effectively.
**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Leaders should ensure AI is used effectively and not just for the sake of using it.

COMPELLING: Don't feel overly pressured just to do AI for the sake of it.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Consider how AI can provide actual benefits to users.

COMPELLING: Try to think through how can we actually offer real user value?

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Teams are facing more uncertainty than before.

COMPELLING: Teams are currently exposed to much more ambiguity than many of them have been.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: The scope of work for teams used to be more defined.

COMPELLING: For a lot of teams, scope used to be contained.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Uncertainty affects daily work significantly.

COMPELLING: It's also impacting the day to day of a lot of people on your team. Very directly and very fundamentally.
**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Discussing these topics is crucial.

COMPELLING: And so speaking to those things, I think is really important.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Recent years have highlighted the need for effective leadership in engineering.

COMPELLING: And I personally have also found that the last couple of years are really a call to many engineering leaders for good leadership practices.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Be a leader, not just a follower of trends or pressures.

COMPELLING: Show up as a leader for them, and not just as someone who passes through things that might be exciting or where there's pressure from your leadership team.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: We are almost finished with our discussion.

COMPELLING: So actually, I'm realizing we're basically closing.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: This was a very interesting discussion.

COMPELLING: This was a really exciting conversation.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Treat AI as a valuable team member that requires direction.

COMPELLING: If I had one piece of advice to give you, it is make sure that you treat AI as a powerful team member that needs guidance.
**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Our aim is to create better software, not just write code quickly.

COMPELLING: And remember that our goal as craftspeople isn't to write code faster. It's to build better software.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: AI can assist us if used properly.

COMPELLING: And if you use AI wisely, it can help us do that.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Leaders need to understand what "better" means and how to achieve it.

COMPELLING: But it is still up to us as leaders to know what better means and how to achieve it.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: Software engineering requires human judgment for complex tasks.

COMPELLING: Because the hard parts of software engineering, you know, understanding requirements and designing maintainable systems, edge cases, security, performance, all of those things still require human judgment, and they're still going to require you and your teams.

**_EXAMPLE_**

BORING: The complexity makes this job interesting and shows the limits of AI.

COMPELLING: I think there's, again, the complexity ultimately is so much of what makes this job interesting and exciting and also makes it a place where generative AI still has its limits, and where humans really can shine and where you as a leader can shine together with your team.
