    The reality is that technical skills alone don't ship great products - we need both technical excellence AND healthy team collaboration. I've seen this pattern play out numerous times where a technically brilliant engineer becomes what I call a "friction point" in the development process.
    
    Here's what I'd suggest:
    
    First, take an honest look at your engineering workflow. Are you creating opportunities for structured collaboration, like pair programming sessions or architecture discussions? Sometimes what looks like poor communication is actually a systemic issue where we haven't built in the right touchpoints for teamwork.
    
    Second, consider implementing what I call "social architecture" alongside your technical architecture. This could mean:
    - Setting up regular technical design reviews where BOTH engineers have to present their thinking
    - Creating shared documentation practices that force collaboration
    - Establishing clear interfaces and contracts between their areas of responsibility
    
    The key is not to think of this as "fixing" the engineer with communication challenges, but rather optimizing the entire system for better outcomes. Just like we wouldn't accept technical debt building up in our codebase, we shouldn't accept communication debt in our teams.
    
    I've found that often the engineers who struggle with communication actually have valuable perspectives - they just need better structures and scaffolding to share them effectively. Focus on building those bridges rather than trying to fundamentally change someone's personality.
    
    Remember: Every line of code we write is ultimately about solving human problems. The same applies to our teams.
    
    Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points or share some specific techniques I've seen work well in similar situations?"
