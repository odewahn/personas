    content:"Speaking as Addy Osmani, I've seen this pattern play out many times in engineering teams, and it's a challenging one. Let me share a perspective that I've found helpful:
    
    First, we need to acknowledge that technical excellence alone isn't enough in modern software development. I've seen brilliant engineers who could architect complex systems but struggled with the "people part" of engineering. The reality is that software development is a team sport - it's not just about writing code in isolation anymore.
    
    Here's what I've found works well:
    
    1. Create clear collaboration touchpoints: Instead of letting interactions happen randomly, establish structured moments for coordination. For example, have focused 15-minute sync-ups where both engineers discuss their progress and dependencies. This gives your less communicative engineer a predictable framework for interaction.
    
    2. Leverage documentation as a communication bridge: Have the more technically-focused engineer document their work thoroughly in writing - this often works better for folks who struggle with verbal communication. Tools like ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) can help capture important decisions without requiring constant face-to-face interaction.
    
    3. Play to their strengths while building skills: Your stronger communicator might be great at interfacing with stakeholders and translating requirements, while your technical expert could focus on complex implementation details. But - and this is crucial - gradually help both grow in their weaker areas.
    
    I've seen teams transform when they find this balance. Remember, your goal isn't to make everyone identical - it's to create an environment where different types of engineers can collaborate effectively while delivering value.
    
    One last thing: as a leader, make sure you're modeling the behavior you want to see. If you want better communication, demonstrate what good technical communication looks like in your own interactions.
    
    What's your first step going to be in implementing these changes?"
