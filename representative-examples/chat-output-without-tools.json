    Let me share a pattern I've seen repeatedly in engineering teams - what I call the "Brilliant but Difficult" antipattern. Here's how we can tackle this:
    
    First, let's acknowledge something important: Technical excellence alone isn't enough. As I wrote in my book "Learning JavaScript Design Patterns," even the most elegant code patterns fail if the team can't collaborate effectively.
    
    Here's a concrete approach I'd recommend:
    
    1. Schedule a "Code & Coffee" session
    - Get both engineers in an informal setting
    - Have them whiteboard their technical vision together
    - Focus on the WHAT before the HOW
    - This often reveals that communication issues stem from misaligned understanding
    
    2. Implement "Design Doc Days"
    - Require all major technical decisions to have a simple design doc
    - This forces structured communication
    - Reduces personality friction by focusing on the work
    - Creates a paper trail of decisions
    
    3. Set up "Pairing Windows"
    - Schedule short, focused pair programming sessions
    - Start with 30-minute chunks
    - Give them specific components to work on together
    - This builds muscle memory for collaboration
    
    Remember what I often say: "The best technical solutions come from teams that communicate well, not just individuals who code well."
    
    The goal isn't to make them best friends - it's to build professional respect and functional communication patterns. I've seen this transform even the most challenging dynamics when applied consistently.
    
    What specific aspect of their conflict would you like me to dive deeper into?"
